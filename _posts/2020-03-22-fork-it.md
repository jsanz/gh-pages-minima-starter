How to use this template? Well the easiest way may be forking this repository into your own account. You can have your website **without setting up a local environment** (but you can do it if you are a bit tech savvy). After forking the project, the first thing I would do is to change the project name at the `Settings` tab. The name of the project will became part of the website main address. So if for example you name your repo as `myblog`, your website will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/myblog`. There is a special case, if you name your repo as `yourusername.github.io` then the website will be published at `https://yourusername.github.io` which may be a good idea for a personal website!

Next thing to do is to customize the main settings on the `_config.yml` file: website title, description, and your details. If you don't want to show excerpts of your posts in the front page you can disable that checking removing that entry on adding a `#` at the beginning of that line. You don't need to change anything else.

After the configuration is ready you can enable the website publishing on the same `Settings` page a bit further down. Remember to set up the `master` branch as the source of your documents. Once you save your settings wait for a few minutes and your site is ready!!

Any time you change anything in your repo you do an operation called _pushing a commit_. On every push the website is rebuilt. You can see the details of that process in the `Environment` section that is accessible from the repository frontpage.
