I am really into making lists. Lists for work tasks, shopping or even house duties. For the last months I have been reading cartography related books a lot. So there you have, my favorite books in a list.

![cartography-books-shelve](https://github.com/ramiroaznar/blog/blob/master/assets/imgs/2020-04-12-books.jpg?raw=true)

### ðŸŽ¼ Fundamentals

* _Cartography._ by **K. Field**. The more detailed cartography glossary you would find in a book shelf. The way it is writen allows you to go as deep as you want in any particular topic. The infographics, maps and annotations are also great.
* [_Introduction to GIS_](https://volaya.github.io/gis-book/en/index.html), and his big brother, [_Sistemas de Informacion Geografica_](https://volaya.github.io/libro-sig/) (only in Spanish) by **Victor Olaya**. These two books are a perfect introduction to GIS. The first is a short essay, while the second is huge text book.
* _Elements of Cartography_ by **A.H. Robinson**. Robinson's book is a classic and a must. I had difficulties to buy it, but it was worth all the pennies. 
* _Mapping It Out_ and _How to Lie with Maps_ by **M. Monmonier**. Everyone knows and cites Monmonier work when warning about the lies and pitfalls that a cartographer could make, but very few I have seen studies and put in practice the first piece of work.
* _How Maps Work_ by **A.M. MacEachren**. Reading and understanding maps is not as easy as communicate a message. MacEachren book is key if we want to know what is behind our eyes and mind when we have a map on front of us. 
* _Semiology of Graphics_ by **J. Bertin**. Although I have not read it yet, its references are all over the place. Hopefully I will be able to adquire on by a reasonable price.
* _Designing Better Maps_ by **C.A. Brewer**. A guide for GIS users to design better maps. I wish I had read this book when I started learning GIS.


### ðŸŽ¸ Practice

* _Visualize This_ by **N. Yau**. Probably the first book I bought on this list. A step by step guide to create and design good infographics (with a big cartography section using Python and R).
* _Cartographer's Toolkit_ by **G.N. Peterson**. Nice ideas to help your cartographic mind and hands.
* _QGIS Map Design_ by **A. Graser and G.N. Peterson**. These two ladies will break your QGIS workflows and expand the variety of styling options. A must.
* _Designed Map. A sourcebook for GIS users_ by **C.A. Brewer**. Similar in a way to Peterson's toolkit, Cyntia's sourcebook is a good compendium of good maps categorized by type.
* _Fantasy Mapmaker and Fantasy Art & RPG Maps_ by **J. Blando**. If you are really into fantasy maps (as I am) these two will be your best friends.

### ðŸ“Š Data Visualization

* _Data Points_ by **N. Yau**. The second book of the author of [the FlowingData blog](https://flowingdata.com/) is perfect as a first dataviz read because of its simple language and amazing inforgraphics.
* _Design for Information_ by **I. Meirelles**. I literally love this book. You can open it in any page and get an amazing visualization with a better explanation of the theory behind.
* _The Art of Statistics_ by **D. Spiegelhalter**. A highly recommend statistic book to review a subject that is constantly used in cartography using real examples.
* _The Truthful Art_, _The Functional Art_ and _How Charts Lie_ by **A. Cairo**.
* _The Visual Display of Quantitative Information_ by **E. Tufte**. A very inspirational book. It is nice to review Tufte's work and see that others have been there and come up with a nicer solution.
* [_Fundamentals of Data Visualization_](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) by **C.O. Wilke**. A very complete open and free dataviz book.

### ðŸŒŽ Geography

* _Geography. Why it matters?_ by **A.B. Murphy**. A nice reading to give you an overview of the past, present and future of geography.
* _Collapse_ and _Guns, Germs and Steel_ by **J. Diamond**. These two books blown my mind. Diamond holistic approach to understand the fate of civilizations are unique. 
* _The Revenge of Geography_ by **R. Kaplan**,  _Prisoners of Geography_ by **T. Marshall** and _Origins. How the Earth Made Us_ by **L. Dartnell**. Similarly to Diamond's work, these three books explain the role of geography in the geopolitics of our era.
* _The Invention of Nature_ by **A. Wulf**. Without Humbdoldt there is no Darwin. A beautiful biography of one of my favorite characters in History.

### ðŸ“œ History

* _Why North is Up_ by **M. Ashworth**. Recommended by Victor Olaya, Ashworth's book is a nice journey through our cartographic bias.
* _The Ghost Map_ by **S. Johnson**. The "real" story behind John Snow's map of cholera outbreaks.
* _Never Lost Again_ by **B. Killday**. The back story of Google Earth and Maps by one of its protagonists.
* _A History of the World in Twelve Maps_ by **J. Brotton**.
* _Longitude_ by **D. Sobel**, _The Great Arc_ by **J. Keay** and _Map of a Nation: A Biography of the Ordnance Survey_ by **R. Hewitt**. Three books to learn about [the longitude problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude#Problem_of_longitude), the measurement of the Himalayas and the mapping of the Indian subcontinent and the History of the British Ordnance Survey respectively.

### ðŸŽ² Miscellaneous

* _Design with Nature_ by **I. McHarg**. Landscape archictecture, land use management, GIS and art, all in one book.
* _Where Animals Go_ by **J. Cheshire** and **O. Uberti**. If you love National Geographic maps, this is your book.
* _On Growth and Form_ by **D. Thompson**. Geometries are a very recurrent topic in cartography. Understanding the evolution and constraints of shapes in Nature could give you a better idea on how to deal with them.
* _The Exposed City_ by **N. Amoroso**. I really love [Hugh Ferriss's drawings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metropolis_of_Tomorrow). As explained in the book, they are three dimensional maps of a possible future.
* _The Secret Live of Colors_ by **K. St. Clair** and _Just My Type_ by **S. Garfield**. These two books go chapter by chapter explaining the stories and curiosities behind each color and type respectively.
* _On the Map_ by **S. Garfield** and _Maphead_ by **K. Jennings**. I had a great time reading these two books, they are a must if you love maps.
