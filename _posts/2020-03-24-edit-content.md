From the [last post]({% link _posts/2020-03-22-fork-it.md %}), your website is published with your details but now how to edit the frontpage, remove the example blog posts or create your own. Let's dive in to that. 

First thing to know is that [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by default accepts rendering content in HTML and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). I **strongly** recommend using Markdown because it's very simple and out of your way when you write, since the formatting rules are very simple. If you are going to write a long piece, you may want to use an external editor and then upload or paste your content into github. There are many text editors that support Markdown but if I have to suggest one that works well for writing I'd go for [typora](https://typora.io/) because it's supporting Linux, Windows, and also MacOS (in beta).
