For the last several months I have been gathering notes from different sources (life and professional experiences, books, discussions...) to structure a book about the complexities that the geospatial sector faces when trying to represent geography. When [Alicia fro Vizzuality](https://twitter.com/AliyGM) invited me to give a talk was a perfect opportunity to convert the content I have been curating into real chapters.

I hope I could use talks like this to come up with the rest of the chapters. As you can see, there is a big Mandalorian influence on the slides [here](bit.ly/geometry-vs-geography). At the end of 2021, the first draft of this book should be ready.
