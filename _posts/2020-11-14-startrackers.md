One month ago I gave my first NACIS (remote) talk called _Star Tracker On: Coordinates Systems in Space_. They were so fast and within a week, the video was already posted in their channel:

You can also download my slides [here](bit.ly/nacis20-startrackeron). But I highly recommend checking the other speakers talks. I was really amaze how well organized the event was, how hight the quality of the talks was, and how great and inclusive the community was. I really hope I could meet them in person in the coming years.
