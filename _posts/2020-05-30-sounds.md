This is going to be a short post. This morning I woke up with the feeling of trying something new. Listening to [a recent podcast about the sound and the voice](http://catastrofeultravioleta.com/) I came up with the idea of making a map for blind people. I found out that there is some research about routing or direction maps for people with limited vision or just blind, but what about thematic webmaps? 

In less than an hour I learn about [how to use the SpechSynthesis API to translate text into speech](https://usefulangle.com/post/98/javascript-text-to-speech). I used Spanish from [this list](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm) of available languages, but the voice still sounds like a robot. The interesting part, as discussed in the podcast, would be improving the voice to be as human as possible. This is the key lines of the code:

```javascript
    const msg = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(region);
    msg.lang='es';
    window.speechSynthesis.speak(msg);
```

Then I built a webmap with interactivity using CARTO VL (but you can use any other webmapping library) and using the new learnings to speak a property when the user hovers over a feature.

<div class="glitch-embed-wrap" style="height: 420px; width: 100%;">
  <iframe
    src="https://glitch.com/embed/#!/embed/sound-web-map?path=index.html&previewSize=100"
    title="sound-web-map on Glitch"
    allow="geolocation; microphone; camera; midi; vr; encrypted-media"
    style="height: 100%; width: 100%; border: 0;">
  </iframe>
</div>

[This is just an example with a category map](https://sound-web-map.glitch.me/), but the same can be applied to choropleths or proportional symbols. Of course, this map alone is not enough to offer a satisfactory experience for blind or limited vision people. You would need a complete UX for this.
