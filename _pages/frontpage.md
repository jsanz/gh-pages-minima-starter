This is a template and some instructions for running Github Pages with the [`minima` theme][minima]. This repo has what I consider the minimum pieces for a personal blog using [Jekyll][jk] and [Github Pages][gh-site].

Check out the excellent [`minima` theme][minima] documentation for further details and customization and the [official docs][gh] for more details on how Github Pages work.
